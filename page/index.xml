      <description>Iâ€™m a data scientist and consultant although originally I studied pharmacy and biology, finishing my Pharm.D./Ph.D. with groups in France, Germany, and the United States.. Besides, being of an inquisitive nature, I usually get interested in miscellaneous subjects. I cultivate coding skills as well as a marked preference for Unix and R.
During my Ph.D. I rapidly got submerged in data, so that I eventually had to code on a daily basis.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve an idea that is worth to create a package about. A list of such projects below.
indexSort This package&amp;ndash;currently hosted on GitHub&amp;ndash;contains functions to retrieve index sorted data and visually explore .fcs date files from various cell sorters.
It has been adapted as a plugin for FlowJo and is available via the FlowJo Exchange.
